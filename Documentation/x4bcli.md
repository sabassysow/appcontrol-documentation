X4B Gateway is necessary to take advantage of agents deployed on premises.

Agents can be deployed anywhere on your I.S. They don't need to have an internet access.

Please refer to the agents installation section for agents installation.

Thanks to X4B Gateway, you can deploy your applications in the AppControl Cloud Platform with Agents deployed on premises.

#### How does it work ?

The first step, is to go log-in on [AppControl](https://appcontrol.xcomponent.com).

1. Navigate to **Gateways** and click on **Register New Gateway**

2. Give a name to your gateway and validate.

3. Once your gateway is created, an Access Key and a Secret Access Key are generated.

4. We are ready to install the X4B Gateway. Please refer to the below documentation for the installation procedure.
5. Because X4B Gateway communicates with agents, you need to install at least one agent.
6. Once your X4B Gateway and your agent are up and running, your are ready to deploy a new application.

### X4B Gateway installation

The first step is to retrieve the X4B Gateway credentials. Navigate to the **Gateway** page and note the following informations:

- Name
- Access Key
- Secret Access Key

## Microsoft Windows Platform

On Microsoft Windows, the [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) or above is required .

Most of the time it is already installed. Unzip the following [file](https://github.com/xcomponent/appcontrol-documentation/releases/latest/download/x4bgateway.zip).

On a prompt (cmd.exe), execute the following command line.
Replace MY_ACCESS_KEY, MY_SECRET_ACCESSKEY and MY_GATEWAY_NAME with the suitable values.

```console
c:\x4b> x4b run gateway -a MY_ACCESS_KEY -k MY_SECRET_ACCESSKEY -p MY_GATEWAY_NAME [-l Trace]
```

You can also, set the following environment variables:

```console
c:\x4b> set X4B_ACCESS_KEY = MY_ACCESS_KEY
c:\x4b> set X4B_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = MY_SECRET_ACCESSKEY
c:\x4b> set X4B_PROXY_NAME = MY_GATEWAY_NAME
```

If the configuration is correct, you should observe the following lines in the terminal:

```console
